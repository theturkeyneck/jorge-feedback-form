            <h2>Some words of Wisdom</h2>
            <p>In the mystical land of APEX, where spreadsheets rule and data flows like 
                mead in a tavern, there exists a valiant yet humble JL3 Data Engineer known 
                as Jorge, the Data Artificer.<br>Now, Jorge isn't just any ordinary data wrangler.
                Oh no, he's embarked on the noble quest of transforming raw, 
                chaotic data into pure, sparkling insights. A task so grand, 
                so heroic, it’s almost as if he’s trying to turn lead into gold.
                But every hero needs their band of companions.<br>Enter you, the 
                seasoned adventurer, armed not with swords or spells, 
                but with something far more powerful... feedback!.<br>Yes, because in 
                this land, no artifact, no matter how polished, is complete without 
                the sage advice of its allies. And let’s be honest, who doesn’t love a 
                good critique session?<br>Your mission, should you choose to accept it 
                (and really, what choice do you have?), is to bestow upon 
                Jorge the attributes that will guide him on his path to become a even better
                artifacter/engineer.<br>
                As you embark on this journey, remember, your feedback is not just a series of 
                numbers. It’s a lifeline, a beacon of hope. Or, you know, just a way to 
                make sure Jorge doesn’t mess up too badly, just like Jeppe the Bard. So, go ahead, rate wisely, 
                comment generously, and let's turn this data adventure into a legendary saga. 
                Or at least into a somewhat coherent project.<br>
                Jorge's success – and possibly his sanity – depends on you. No pressure.</p>
            <h2>Scoring System</h2>
            <p>Lets start by understanding the scoring system. The d20 will become a d5 today, which will mean:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>1 - (Feeble):</strong> Like a goblin with a dull dagger, I struggle to make an impact and need significant improvement.</li>
                <li><strong>2 - (Mediocre):</strong> Similar to a wandering orc, my performance falls below expectations.</li>
                <li><strong>3 - (Adept):</strong> Much like a seasoned adventurer, I meet expectations with proficiency.</li>
                <li><strong>4 - (Exemplary):</strong> Comparable to a mighty dragon, my performance exceeds expectations.</li>
                <li><strong>5 - (Legendary):</strong> Like an ancient wizard mastering the arcane, my performance is truly outstanding, setting a standard for all.</li>
            </ul>
