            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Welcome, APEX adventurer, to a realm where feedback is the key to growth and development.
                <br>Just as heroes in Dungeons & Dragons rely on their companions'strength, 
                insights and wisdom to conquer mighty foes, so does I, Jorge, the Data Artificer 
                and I need your guidance to excel in my noble quest of supporting APEX on having reliable 
                data for experiments and analytics.</p>
            <p>Feedback is crucial! You are to make my characters sheet, where you 
                will be granting me stats on the following attributes:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Charisma (CHA): The ability to charm and communicate effectively.</li>
                <li>Intelligence (INT): Problem-solving skills and technical knowledge.</li>
                <li>Wisdom (WIS): The ability to understand the product and derived value.</li>
                <li>Dexterity (DEX): Agility and adaptability with new tasks.</li>
                <li>Strength (STR): Resilience and endurance. Completes tasks and delivers on time.</li>
                <li>Creativity (CRT): Innovation and problem-solving abilities.</li>
                <li>Collaboration (COL): The ability to work with each other. Teamwork.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Don't forget to also leave comments on how I could improve so I can level my stats up. <br> Please do not roll a dice on these, because providing thoughtful and insightful 
                feedback will help me on my journey to greatness... and so yours too.</p>
            <p>Are you ready to embark on this adventure?</p>
